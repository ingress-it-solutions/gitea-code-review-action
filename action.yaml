    - Focus on items mentioned in the given code review checklist:
        Code Structure
          - Validation
          - Business logic should be in service class
          - Dont repeat yourself (DRY)
          - Prefer to use Eloquent over using Query Builder and raw SQL queries. Prefer collections over arrays
          - Mass assignment
          - Do not execute queries in Blade templates and use eager loading (N + 1 problem)
          - Chunk data for data-heavy tasks
          - Comment your code, but prefer descriptive method and variable names over comments
          - Do not put JS and CSS in Blade templates and do not put any HTML in PHP classes
          - Use config and language files, constants instead of text in the code
          - Use standard Laravel tools accepted by community
          - Follow Laravel naming conventions
          - Use shorter and more readable syntax where possible
          - Use IoC container or facades instead of new Class
          - Are there any unnecessary files, folders, or code modules?
          - Does the code follow the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) and Dont Repeat Yourself (DRY) principle?
        Error Handling
          - Are all error scenarios covered in the code?
          - Are the error messages clear and helpful?
          - Is the code handling errors gracefully?
        Security
          - Are sensitive data and credentials stored securely?
          - Are all external libraries and packages up-to-date?
          - Is the code protected against common security vulnerabilities such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS)?
